Gradle Update receives an event from GitHub and checks version of Gradle Wrapper in your repositories. It can access to only public repositories.

----

**Step 2:** Open [notifications page](https://github.com/notifications). You will receive pull requests for updating Gradle Wrapper after a few minutes.

----

**Step 3:** Merge a pull request if all tests have passed.

Once starred, you will receive pull requests when a new version of Gradle is released. You can turn off Gradle Update by removing the star at any time.

----

**Optional:** Add a badge to indicate the build system is up-to-date, e.g.:

[![Gradle Status](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/int128/latest-gradle-wrapper/status.svg?branch=master)](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/int128/latest-gradle-wrapper/status)

Add the following line to `README.md` in your repositories. Replace `USER` with the user name, and `REPO` with the repository name.

```markdown
[![Gradle Status](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/USER/REPO/status.svg?branch=master)](https://gradleupdate.appspot.com/USER/REPO/status)
```


## How Gradle Update works

When a _user_ added a star to Gradle Update repository,

1. Receive an event from GitHub and queue a task for _user_.
2. In a task for the _user_,
  1. Get a list of repositories of _user_.
  2. Queue tasks for each _repositories_.
3. In a task for the _repository_,
  1. Check version of Gradle Wrapper in the _repository_.
  2. If following conditions are satisfied, queue a task for updating the _repository_.
    1. The _repository_ contains Gradle Wrapper.
    2. Gradle Wrapper of the _repository_ is out-of-date.
    3. There is no pull request already sent.
4. In a task for updating the _repository_,
  1. Fork the _repository_.
  2. Create a commit with the latest Gradle Wrapper from [latest-gradle-wrapper](https://github.com/int128/latest-gradle-wrapper).
  3. Create a pull request.

Periodically,

1. Check the latest version of Gradle from [services.gradle.org](https://services.gradle.org).
2. If a new version of Gradle is found,
  1. Trigger updating Gradle Wrapper on [latest-gradle-wrapper](https://github.com/int128/latest-gradle-wrapper).
  2. Wait until the new version is available on [latest-gradle-wrapper](https://github.com/int128/latest-gradle-wrapper).
  3. Get a list of stargazers of this repository and queue tasks for each _user_.

When a badge for the _repository_ is requested,

1. Check the version of Gradle Wrapper in the _repository_.
2. If it is up-to-date, respond the green image.
3. If it is out-of-date, respond the red image.
4. If it has no Gradle Wrapper, respond the grey image.
